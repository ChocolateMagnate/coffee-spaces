    <h1>Welcome to the Coffee Spaces!</h1>

    <h2>How do we work?</h2>
    <p>We thrive to deliver the one space to create, store, manage your codebase, while 
        providing the line of communication with your team and the tools to nurture developers.
    </p>
    <p>On our platform, you can create <b>teams</b> and assign different <b>projects</b> to them.
        In every team there's a <i>team lead</i> that has the administrative rights as well as 
        different ranks that have the tools to do their job:
